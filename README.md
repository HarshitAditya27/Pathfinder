## Introduction 🐱‍💻
- Pathfinder is an interactive web application designed to visualize a variety of pathfinding algorithms, including Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, and more. The app enables users to visually explore the paths between two points within a maze generated by data structure patterns such as Binary Tree and Recursive Division. This tool provides an intuitive and educational experience for understanding how different algorithms operate in solving complex problems related to pathfinding and graph traversal.
